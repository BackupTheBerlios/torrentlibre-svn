This TODO list is currently describing the main features which have to be implemented and some points we have to care.

- add a pdf viewer (probably based on poppler) for text reading
- add an audio player (based on SDL_mixer) for music listening
- add a module to send new torrent for moderators
- add the bittorrent part to download files
- define and implement the connection and search protocols
